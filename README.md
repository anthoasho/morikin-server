#Morikin

This is a work in progress by [Anthony Ashurst](https://github.com/anthoasho).



## Outline

Morikin is a very basic social networking single page application written in the MERN stack (Mongo, Express, React, Node).

It's currently a "private" application, meaning it requires some kind of login to access (a preview mode is to be made also). The application is currently quite minimal in total features.


## Features

- Post single messages up to 160 characters
- Like messages
- Follow and view followers of users
- Soft deletion of messages
- Basic discover feature to find other users
- Edit your profile with a Profile picture, description and colour


## Future Plans

[ ] Message replies
[ ] Preview mode (look at basic profile before following/logging in)
[ ] Hashtag feature
[ ] Improve privacy with follow requests and denials
[ ] Improve discover box with appropriate people to follow
[ ] General code cleanup
[ ] Expand Edit Profile

## Application Details

The front end was created with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). 


## History and About the Author

This entire project has been a tool for learning React as well as developing previous knowledge on both backend and front end development. It began as a side project in the January 2018 made solely in my free time. It has helped me develop a number of different skills over that time as well as truly introducing me to using github. The work has been a solo project during this time, allowing me to solve problems and issues alone and learn from them effectively.

I am a self-taught developer who has been studying in free time with small projects in Codepen, small applications on cloud 9 and js/html/css single pages. This is my first attempt at a full scale front end and back end project. While I have worked on this project I have had the opportunity to develop my javascript abilities and write better code overall - it still has a lot of work to go and I hope to continue developing these skills over time.
